Tuesday 09:00 - 10:50
---------------------

+ Data collection activity (used mainly to emphasise different data types, but can also use in future classes e.g. data viz and testing).
+ Collect the following data as a class:

  + Gender (nominal)
  + Eye colour (nominal, usually have discussion around which categories to include)
  + Height (ratio, discuss units, measurement accuracy, keep consistent across class)
  + Date of birth (interval)
  + Order entered the class (ordinal, how to get this? stand in line, talk, etc.)
  + Foot size (interval (shoe size), ratio (foot length), discuss what we mean here)
  + Distance home-work (ratio, discuss units)


+ Briefly discuss data visualisation concepts (distance, area, angle, colour...), and common data visualisation charts (bar chart, scatter plot, histogram, line plot).
+ Give each group graph paper, each group to draw a data visualisation of some variables from yesterday's data collection (e.g. eye-colour bar chart; height histogram; height-distance scatter plot) but do not give guidance.
+ Each group shows their data visualisation to the class (using overhead projector) and explains why they drew that (data types). Let groups provide some feedback (and give feedback ourselves).
