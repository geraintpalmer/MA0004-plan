===================
Week 2 - Set Theory
===================


Monday 10:00 - 10:50
--------------------

+ Introduction to set theory (some slides and class questions).
+ Show online interactive Venn tool
+ Set theory activity

  + Pair activity: `Venn diagram matching game <_static/venns-card-sort.pdf>`_


Tuesday 09:00 - 10:50
---------------------

+ Work on tutorial sheet 1, set theory (1 hour).

+ Probability ordering activity

  + Class activity: A list of events are given (e.g. roll a 6 on a die, the sun will shine tomorrow, the sun will set tonight, the sun will fall out of the sky). Ask students to categorise and order them along a scale from "Impossible" - "Unlikely" - "Likely" - "Certain".
  + Rename scale to "0" - "0.25" - "0.75" - "1". Ask if we'd like to rearrange some of the events.
  + Discuss meaning of probability. Think about differences between uncertain events such as "roll a 6" and "the sun will shine", for example.
