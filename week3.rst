====================
Week 3 - Probability
====================


Monday 10:00 - 10:50
--------------------

+ Law of large numbers activity.
  
  + Split class into four groups. Give each an event, e.g.:
  
    + Get 3 heads in 5 coin tosses.
    + Draw two red cards in a hand of two cards.
    + Roll two dice and the minimum is less than 3.

  + Ask the groups to calculate the probability of the event occuring.
  + Ask the group to perform the experiment 20 times, recording the number of times the event occured.
  + Bring class together, in turn each group will explain how they calculates the probability of their event, and will input their data into a spreadsheet. This will show the long run average converging to the calcuated probability over time.
  + Wrap up by saying this is the law of large numbers.


Tuesday 09:00 - 10:50
---------------------

+ Probability theory activity

  + Group activity: `True or False probability statements <_static/Probability-TrueFalse.pdf>`_:.

+ Work on tutorial sheet 2, probability.
