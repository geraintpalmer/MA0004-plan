Play the epidemiology activity.

+ Open with the question: "Imagine if one day a student came in sick with a nasty infectious disease. How long would it take for that disease to spread through the whole university?" What factors effect this? Try to get answers such as:

  + Number of students
  + Probability of transmitting disease (how? cough? touch? sexually? how do these effect probability?)
  + Recovery rate

+ The game:

  + Each student is given a dice.
  + Each student can either be *Susceptible* (remain seated), *Infected* (stood up) or *Recovered* (at the back of the room). Start the game with all students *Susceptible*, except 1, who is *Infected*.
  + Each round:

    + Each *Infected* student interacts with **every** *Susceptible* student. An interaction consists of both student rolling their dice. If the combined score is 11 or 12 then the *Susceptible* student becomes *Infected* (they do not interact with anyone else this round).
    + After these interactions each *Infected* student (except newly infected students) roll their die twice. If the total of the two rolls is 5, they become *Recovered*.
    + Repeat until everyone is *Recovered* (or too much time has passed).
    + Discuss randomness, probabilities.

  + After each round, record in a table the number of *Susceptible*, *Infected* and *Recovered* students. The table may look like this:

	=====  ===========  ========  =========
	Round  Susceptible  Infected  Recovered
	=====  ===========  ========  =========
	0      29           1         0
	1      26           4         0
	2      24           5         1
	=====  ===========  ========  =========

+ After playing the game, type numbers into the epidemiology spreadsheet. Look at graphs. Discuss data visualisation, mean values, etc. Discuss 'what if''s and play around with the spreadsheet, e.g.

  + What is the disease was more infectious?
  + What if infected people were put into quarantine for a period of time?
  + What if contact rate was different?
